# 🏏 T20 World Cup 2022 Data Analysis

### **Project Overview**
A data-driven sports analytics project aimed at assembling the theoretically "Best 11" cricket squad from the T20 World Cup 2022. By analyzing match-level data, I developed a performance dashboard to select players based on impact metrics rather than reputation.

### **🛠 Tech Stack**
* **Data Cleaning & ETL:** Python (Pandas, JSON handling)
* **Visualization:** Microsoft Power BI
* **Analytics:** Advanced DAX (Calculated Measures & Columns)

### **✨ Key Features**
* **End-to-End Pipeline:** Transformed unstructured JSON data (match summaries) into a Star Schema data model.
* **Advanced Metrics:** Engineered custom KPIs using DAX, including **Boundary %**, **Dot Ball %**, and **Batting Average**, to quantify player impact.
* **Role-Based Selection:** Implemented dynamic filtering to select players for specific roles (e.g., *Power Hitters* need Strike Rate > 140; *Anchors* need Avg > 40).
* **Outcome:** Identified a final squad of 11 players statistically capable of scoring **180+ runs** on average and defending targets within **150 runs**.
